  <h2>BONUS HOMEWORK</h2>
  <p>
    Make a crystal ball program that predicts the future

        The program generates a random number from 1 to 5
        The crystal ball should give you a response:
            1 - You are on the right track
            2 - Danger is near
            3 - Luck will find you
            4 - You are about to make a mistake
            5 - Your future is unclear
        TIP: There is a function for randomly generating numbers!
